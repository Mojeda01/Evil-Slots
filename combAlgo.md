# Roadmap for developing the slot game selection model
## Phase 1: Foundation setup
1. **Define game elements**
    - **Symbols List:** Identify all symbols in the game (e.g., 🍒, 🍋, 🔔, ⭐, 💎)
    - **Reels Configuration:** Decide on the number of reels and symbols per reel (e.g., 3 reels 5 symbols each).
    - **Payout Structure:** Determine the payout amounts for each possible winning combination (e.g., three cherries = 2 USD, three stars = 3 USD).

2. **Design slot value distribution (SLD)**
    - **Base Probability Assignment**
