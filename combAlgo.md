# Roadmap for developing the slot game selection model
## Phase 1: Foundation setup
1. **Define game elements**
    - **Symbols List:** Identify all symbols in the game (e.g., 🍒, 🍋, 🔔, ⭐, 💎)
    - **Reels Configuration:** Decide on the number of reels and symbols per reel (e.g., 3 reels 5 symbols each).
    - **Payout Structure:** Determine the payout amounts for each possible winning combination (e.g., three cherries = 2 USD, three stars = 3 USD).

2. **Design slot value distribution (SLD)**
    - **Base Probability Assignment:** Create a probability distribution for each symbol on each reel. Use a weighted distribu
    tion that skews in favor of the house. For example:
        - Common symbols (🍒, 🍋) = Higher probabilities.
        - Rare symbols (💎, ⭐) = Lower probabilities.
    - **Create a probability data structure:**
        - Implement a table or dictionary to store these probabilities for each reel (e.g., { 'Reel1': {'🍒': 5, '🍋': 4, '🔔': 3, '⭐': 2, '💎': 1}, ... }).
3. **Develop Initial 'spin_reels()' Function**
    - **Random symbol selection:**
        - Implement a function that randomly selects a symbol for eachr eel based on the assigned probabilities.
    - **Weighted random choice mechanism**
        - Use a weighted random choice algorithm to select symbols in line with the SLD. This ensures some symbols appear more frequently than others.

## Phase 2: Build and integrate the combination system
1. **Define winning combinations:**
    - **List all possible combinations:**
        - Define all possible winning combinations and map them to their respective payouts.
    - **Create a mapping system**
        - Implement a dictionary or lookup table that links symbol combinations to payouts.
2. **Design slot value distribution (SLD)**
    - **Base probability Assignment:**
        - Create a probability distribution for each symbol on each reel. Use a weighted distribution that skews in favor of the house. For example:
            - Common symbols (🍒, 🍋) = Higher probabilities.
            - Rare symbols (💎, ⭐) = Lower probabilities.
    - **Create a Probability Data Structure:**
        - Implement a table or dictionary to store these probabilities for each reel (e.g., { 'Reel1': {'🍒': 5, '🍋': 4, '🔔': 3, '⭐': 2, '💎': 1}, ... }).
3. **Develop Initial 'spin_reels()' Function**
    - **Random Symbol Selection:**
        - Implement a function that randomly selects a symbol from each reel based on the assigned probabilities.
    - **Weighted Random Choice Mechanism:**
        - Use a weighted random choice algorithm to select symbols in line with the SLD. This ensures some symbols appear more frequently than others.

## Phase 2: Build and Integrate the Combination System
1. **Define Winning Combinations**
    - **List all possible combinations**
        - Define all possible winning combinations and map them to their respective payouts.
    - **Create a mapping system**
        - Implement a dictionary or lookup table that links symbol combinations to payouts.
2. **Implement the combination checking logic**
    - **Develop Combination Checker:**
        - Write a function to check the result of each spin against the predefined winning combinations.
    - **Calculate and Return Payouts:**
        - Integrate the combination checker with the reward system to calculate and display payouts based on the spin results.
3. **Integrate User Feedback Loop**
    - **Display Results to Player:**
        - Output the result of each spin, showing the symbols on each reel and the payout amount (if any).
    - **Prompt for next action:**
        - Allow the player to decide whether to play again or quit.
***

## Phase 3: Implement Dynamic Adjustment Mechnaisms
1. **Dynamic Probability Adjustment**
    - **Track Game State34 and Statistics:**
        - Implement a function to monitor game statistics (e.g., win/loss streaks, total number of spins, total payouts).
    - **Adjust SLD Based on Performance:**
        - Develop a mechanism to dynamically adjust the SLD based on game statistics to maintain the desired house hedge.
            - Slightly increase the likelihood of small wins after several losses to keep players engaged.
            - Reduce winning probabilities slightly after a big win.
2. **Implement Adaptive Probability Adjustment**
    - **Define Adjustment Rules:**
        - Set specific rules for adjusting probabilities based on certain conditions, such as the nummber of consecutive losses or wins.
    - **Automate Adjustments:**
        - Write a function that automatically adjusts the symbol probabilities on each reel based on these rules.
***

## Phase 4: Test and Optimize the Algorithm
1. **Develop and Run Unit Tests**
    - **Test Core Functions:**
        - Write unit tests for the `spin_reels()` function, combination checker, and dynamic adjustment mechanisms.
    - **Validate Game Logic:**
        - Ensure probabilities, combination checks, and payout calculations work as intended over time.
2. **Simulate Long-Term Gameplay**
    - **Run Simulations:**
        - Conduct extensive simulations (e.g., thousands of spins) to verify that the house edge and dynamic adjustment mechanism are functioning correctly.
    - **Analyze Results:**
        - Collect data from simulations and adjust the SLD, payout structure, or other aspects as needed to achieve the desired game balance.
3. **Optimize Algorithm Perfomance**
    - **Refactor for Efficiency:**
        - Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks, especially in the selection model and combination checker functions.
    - **Ensure Modularity**
        - Make sure each component (SLD, combination checker, dynamic adjustment) is modular, allowing for easy future adjustments.
***

## Phase 5: Documentation and Future Enhancements Planning
1. **Document the algorithm**
    - **Comprehensive Documentation:**
        - Provide clear documentation for each function, data structure, and mechanism explaining their purposes, inputs, outputs, and behaviors.
    - **Create a Developer Guide**
        - Develop a guide that outlines how to modify the algorithm's parameters, such as symbols, payouts, and probability distributions.
2. **Plan for future enhancements:**
    - **Identify potential new features**
        - List possible future enhancements, such as introducing new symbols, special events, or additional adjustment rules.
    - **Prepare for scalability**
        - Ensure the codebase is designed to be easily scalable and flexible for future updates or changes.
