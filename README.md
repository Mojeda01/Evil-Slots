# Slot Machine Simulation Project

## Description

This project is a comprehensive slot machine simulation system, including a core slot machine algorithm, and a diagnostics tool for performance analysis. It aims to provide a realistic slot machine experience while offering tools for analysis and optimization.

## Components

1. **Slot Machine Core (reelAlgo.py)**
   - Implements the core slot machine logic
   - Handles reel spinning, win calculations, and payout management
   - Manages special features like bonus rounds and jackpots

3. **Diagnostics Tool (diagnostics_tool.py)**
   - Analyzes slot machine performance in real-time
   - Displays key statistics and performance graphs
   - Helps in tuning and optimizing the slot machine algorithm

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- DearPyGui (for Diagnostics Tool)

## Features

- Multiple paylines and configurable reel symbols
- Special features like wilds, scatters, and bonus rounds
- Real-time logging of each spin for analysis
- Comprehensive diagnostics tool for performance tracking
