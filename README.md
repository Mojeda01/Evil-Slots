# Slot Machine Simulation Project

This project simulates a slot machine game with a graphical user interface and a diagnostics tool for performance analysis.

## Components

### 1. Slot Machine Algorithm (reelAlgo.py)

This script implements the core logic of the slot machine game. Key features include:

- Reel spinning mechanism with configurable symbol probabilities
- Multiple paylines for win calculation
- Bonus game functionality
- Currency and token management
- Jackpot system integration
- Logging of game results

The script provides a text-based interface for playing the game, allowing users to place bets, spin the reels, and participate in bonus rounds.

### 2. Diagnostics Tool (diagnostics_tool.py)

This tool provides real-time analysis and visualization of the slot machine's performance. Features include:

- Automatic updates based on changes in the log file
- Display of key statistics (total spins, winnings, average win, RTP)
- Multiple charts for data visualization:
  - Average Win per Spin
  - Balance Over Time
  - Bet Amount Distribution
  - Points Won Over Time
  - Winnings Breakdown
  - Jackpot Progression
  - Win Frequency
  - RTP Over Time
  - Bonus Trigger Frequency

The tool uses DearPyGui for creating an interactive graphical interface with multiple charts arranged in a grid layout.

### 3. Jackpot Manager (jackpot_manager.py)

This module manages the jackpot functionality for the slot machine game. It handles:

- Initializing and loading the jackpot value from a file
- Incrementing the jackpot based on bets placed
- Saving the updated jackpot value
- Checking for jackpot wins
- Resetting the jackpot when necessary

The jackpot value is stored in a JSON file and increases by a configurable percentage of each bet placed.

## Usage

1. Run `reelAlgo.py` to play the slot machine game.
2. Run `diagnostics_tool.py` to view real-time performance analytics.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- DearPyGui

## Files

- `reelAlgo.py`: Main slot machine game logic
- `diagnostics_tool.py`: Performance analysis and visualization tool
- `jackpot_manager.py`: Jackpot management module
- `logs.json`: Game result logs (generated by reelAlgo.py)
- `jackpot.json`: Stores the current jackpot value

## Future Improvements

- Implement a graphical user interface for the slot machine game
- Enhance the diagnostics tool with more advanced analytics
- Add more customization options for the slot machine configuration
